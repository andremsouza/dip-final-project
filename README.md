## Abstract
This project aims to build a digital business card wallet, as a mobile application. This application basically can take a picture of a business card, automatically extracting information about the card, and saves it in the user digital wallet. During this process, there are digital image processing techniques, such as (1) image denoising / deblurring, (2) image segmentation, and natural language processing techniques for categorizing the extracted text (name, company, job position, email, ...). The application should be able to process and extract information from images with different perspectives and possible presence of undesired objects, such as in the examples below.
